# codee-class: A LaTeX Document Class for the Community of Ordinary Differential Equations Educators (CODEE)


The **Community of Ordinary Differential Equations Educators** (CODEE) exists to
improve the teaching and learning of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), primarily by encouraging broader use of modeling
projects and computer experiments.  CODEE publishes an electronic journal containing learning materials relating to ODEs called the _CODEE Journal_. This journal is published online at the _CODEE Digital Library_, accessible at http://www.codee.org/.

The LaTeX class, `codee.cls`, provides the basic formatting for a
submission to the _CODEE Journal_.  Included with the class is the
`how-to-prepare-manuscripts.tex` document and its typeset version,
`how-to-prepare-manuscripts.pdf`, which provide examples and
additional information about writing CODEE submissions.
